## The root we never question

From work to education, from healthcare to housing, from the food on our table to the relationships we build — nearly every aspect of human life passes through a transaction. We are so deeply forged by this link that we rarely notice it, let alone question it.

Yet this is a choice — not a law of nature. And it comes at a cost: talent wasted by the infinity of uselessness, hope muffled by surrender dressed as realism, and a species that excels at inheriting knowledge but fails at inheriting wisdom — condemned to repeat, endlessly, the mistakes of the past.

## Our path: building and living the worlds of tomorrow

We could do what so many already do, courageously: try to change the current world. Spend our energy convincing, fighting *against* countless forces and resistances, tolerating endless setbacks.

European Dream takes another path. We dream, we design, we **experiment** with other societies — so that we, or others, may one day choose to live in them. Not by tearing down what exists, but by building what comes next.

This does not mean abandoning our individual commitments elsewhere. It simply means that European Dream makes a deliberate choice — ambitious enough on its own — to focus entirely on tomorrow.
