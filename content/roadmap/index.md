## Current status

European Dream is in **early bootstrapping**.

Everything is tentative, documented, and revisable. No legal entity exists yet. No formal membership is open. We are in the conceptual and preparatory phase.

---

## The path forward

Our organisational development follows a deliberate sequence:

### Phase 1: Conceptual bootstrapping
*Current phase*

- Define foundational assumptions and constraints
- Document the project's purpose and limits
- Establish communication channels
- Build initial website and public presence
- Identify founding participants

**Status**: In progress

---

### Phase 2: Belgian ASBL

The first legal structure will be a Belgian **ASBL** (Association Sans But Lucratif—non-profit association).

**Why Belgium?**
- Political stability and resistance to ideological interference
- Strong legal framework for associations
- Central location within the EU
- Multilingual administrative environment
- Established tradition of civil society organisations

**What the ASBL enables:**
- Legal identity for contracts and agreements
- Bank account for necessary expenses
- Formal membership structure
- Transparent governance

**What the ASBL does not imply:**
- Commercial activity
- Employment relationships
- Property ownership
- Political representation

The ASBL serves experimentation, not institution-building.

**Status**: Preparation phase

---

### Phase 3: Experimental operations

Once the legal structure exists, we begin structured experiments:

- Small-scale tests of non-monetary coordination
- Documentation of methods and outcomes
- Iterative refinement based on results
- Publication of findings (successes and failures)

This phase has no fixed timeline. We proceed at the pace that honest experimentation allows.

**Status**: Planned

---

### Phase 4: European scope (conditional)

If experiments prove valuable and demand exists, the ASBL may convert to an **AISBL** (Association Internationale Sans But Lucratif—international non-profit association).

This would enable:
- Operations across EU Member States
- Formal international membership
- Larger-scale experimentation

This phase is **conditional**. It depends on:
- Evidence that our methods produce useful results
- Genuine interest from participants in other countries
- Sufficient organisational capacity

We do not assume this phase will happen. It is a possibility, not a plan.

**Status**: Contingent on earlier phases

---

## Timeline

We do not provide time estimates.

Experience teaches that meaningful work takes as long as it takes. Artificial deadlines lead to rushed decisions and compromised integrity.

What we can say:
- Phase 1 will continue until foundational work is complete
- Phase 2 will begin when founding participants are ready
- Subsequent phases depend on outcomes, not schedules

---

## Governance principles

As the project develops, governance will follow these principles:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Transparency** | All decisions documented and publicly accessible |
| **Reversibility** | No decision is permanent; all can be reconsidered |
| **Minimal structure** | Only as much organisation as necessary |
| **No concentration** | No single person controls critical functions |
| **Legal compliance** | All activities within EU legal frameworks |

---

## How to follow progress

Updates will be published on this website as the project develops.

For those interested in closer involvement, the [Contact](/contact/) page provides ways to reach us.

We are not currently accepting formal membership or financial contributions. When that changes, it will be announced publicly.

---

## A note on failure

The roadmap includes an implicit possibility: that the project ends.

If our experiments consistently fail, if we cannot find sustainable ways to operate, or if we conclude that the foundational assumptions were wrong—we will say so clearly and wind down the project.

Failure is not shameful. Pretending to succeed when we have failed would be.

The roadmap is a direction, not a guarantee.
