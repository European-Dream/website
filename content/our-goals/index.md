**Our goals share a single hope: to pave the path for all that might become within a holomutualist society, far from transactionalism, so that a future generation may inherit sound, tangible, and tested foundations for what such an alternative could be.**

These alternatives are – for us – inseparable from ecosystem balance, individual freedom, collective wisdom, and enthusiastic but thoughtful technological progress.

To some, this may sound unattainable. And that very reaction is symptomatic of how outdated our world has become – resisting change rather than embracing it, casting alternatives as impossibilities, and often dressing renouncement up as realism. Because of this, there are so many assumptions we may never think to question.

Whether one looks at our societies through empathy, and recognises how inhuman and destructive we have become, or through reason, and sees how inefficient we are at making meaningful progress, and at addressing the greatest challenges we face, it becomes difficult to believe there are no better ways to live our lives.

This is what European Dream challenges, with hope but no delusion.<br>
We will fail. Likely many times. And we will learn.

What we are attempting requires so much patience, time, and reflection.<br>
Urgency has no place within European Dream. Only importance does.<br>
And any rhythm is acceptable.

## We explore

At European Dream, we are all explorers. Because we all – at the very least – come with a lifelong experience of, _well_, living.

Some a little longer than others. Yet there is little chance we will ever come close to discovering how rich each of our beings – thus each of our social journeys – truly is.

For us, exploration is the harmonious conjunction of four elements: inheriting from those who thought and experimented before us; listening to those who are not among us; encountering one another; and deepening our understanding of ourselves.

## We dream

We are also all dreamers. Not because of our name, but because it would be utterly senseless for any of our members not to take part in proposing, discussing, and shaping what our new worlds could be.

What we call dreaming is far from an attempt to escape reality. It is the first step towards founding another one – and it begins by facing our own without timidity or idealisation.

Dreaming is where we collectively breathe: drawing in as much imagination as we can allow, and breathing out as many sound solutions as our societies can hold.

## We architect

Architecting is, at once, the most crucial, the most unforgiving, and likely the hardest part of our endeavour.

This is where we turn thrilling theories into experiments we can run. It is also where idealism is embraced, but ideologism is unacceptable. There are few things less human than perfection, and architecting must make room for the messy parts of who we are.

Architecting is our ambitious but humble sociological handicraft: constraints will make us struggle, fail, learn – and sometimes shine, as they push us towards simple, resilient choices that still make room for human complexity.

## We experiment

The Great Dive! And the most exhilarating step of our goals: living our European Dream.

Our experiments will be many, and they may take countless forms – a few weeks or a few months somewhere in Europe, online or in person, among ourselves or alongside others.

Living with others – and sometimes with ourselves – can be an emotional upheaval, especially in a society that seeks to replace transactions with helpfulness, balance, and spontaneous recognition. Yet beyond those failures and disappointments lies the question European Dream ultimately tries to answer: **as a species, are we condemned to eternal immaturity, or can we grow beyond ourselves and usher in another Age?**

## In a Living Motion

Our goals are not a straight line, but a set of living loops. Many will run in parallel – decentralisation is the rule. Disagreement is not a threat to unity, but an invitation to fork, to diversify, and to test. What we seek is not a final truth, but a contextual alignment that holds – for as long as it serves.
