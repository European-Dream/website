description: "What European Dream aims to explore: directions of experimentation, constraints, and what success might look like."

## What we aim to explore

European Dream is not building a product or promoting a doctrine. We are exploring whether certain forms of human cooperation can function outside purely transactional logic.

This exploration has no predetermined destination.

---

## Directions of inquiry

We are interested in paths **away from purely transactional coordination**, which may include:

### Partial de-monetisation

Can certain activities be organised without monetary exchange? Not everything, not forever, but specific domains where other forms of coordination might work better.

Examples worth investigating:
- Skill sharing and mutual assistance
- Resource pooling and commons management
- Care work and community support

### Non-monetary reciprocity

Can contribution and reciprocity function without price signals? What forms of acknowledgement, gratitude, or mutual obligation might emerge when money is not the primary medium?

### Shared responsibility

Can responsibility be distributed without ownership? Traditional models tie control to property. We are curious whether responsibility can be decoupled from possession.

### Trust-based coordination

Can trust substitute for contracts in certain contexts? Not naive trust, but structured systems that build and verify trustworthiness over time.

---

## What success looks like

Success for European Dream is **not** proving that non-transactional society works. Success is:

- **Honest documentation** of what we try and what happens
- **Useful failures** that teach something about human coordination
- **Reproducible methods** that others can test and improve
- **Legal compliance** throughout our experimentation
- **No harm** to participants or surrounding communities

A well-documented failure is more valuable than a poorly understood success.

## Non-negotiable constraints

Certain boundaries are fixed. They are not subject to revision regardless of what the experiment might suggest:

| Constraint | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| **No ideological alignment** | Participation requires no political, religious, or economic beliefs |
| **No rejection of law** | We work within EU legal frameworks, not against them |
| **No exclusion** | No one is excluded based on their views about society or economics |
| **No dependency** | Participation must remain compatible with external employment |
| **No promises** | We offer no guarantee of economic security or material benefit |

These constraints exist to prevent European Dream from becoming what it is not: a cult, a commune, a political movement, or a utopian scheme.

---

## What we will not do

To be explicit about our limits:

- We will not advocate for policy changes or political action
- We will not promise that our experiments will improve anyone's life
- We will not create dependency relationships that trap participants
- We will not claim moral superiority over transactional society
- We will not pretend to have answers we do not have

---

## Participation requirements

Contributing to European Dream requires:

- **Critical thinking**: Question assumptions, including ours
- **Tolerance for uncertainty**: Accept that we may fail
- **Good faith**: Engage honestly, without hidden agendas
- **Intellectual honesty**: Report what happens, not what we wish happened

Consensus is not required. Agreement is not expected. Only honest engagement.

---

## A note on scale

European Dream begins small. We are not trying to change the world or build a mass movement.

The initial scope is:
- A small group of founding participants
- Limited, reversible experiments
- Careful documentation of process and outcomes

If something works, it can be shared. If nothing works, we will say so clearly and close the project.

Scale follows evidence, not ambition.
