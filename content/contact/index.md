## Postal Address

European Dream is currently in the process of being formally constituted as a Belgian non-profit association (ASBL), with the intention to later evolve into an international non-profit association (AISBL).

As a result, **no official postal address is available at this stage**.

This section will be updated as soon as the legal structure is finalised.

## Our Use of Social Media {#social-media}

European Dream maintains a differentiated presence across online platforms in order to balance reach, coherence, editorial quality, and alignment with our values.

Not all platforms play the same role, and not all are actively used at this stage.

### Actively Used Platforms

These platforms are our primary channels for communication, collaboration, and publication. They are actively maintained and reflect our current editorial tone.

- **[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@european_dream)** – Announcements, open discussions, and decentralised dialogue.
- **[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/european-dream.eu)** – Announcements, short-form updates and interactions.
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/European-Dream/)** – Documentation, collaborative work, and source code publication.
- **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/european-dream/)** – Announcements, institutional articles, and outreach.
- **[Medium](https://medium.com/@european_dream)** – Essays, interviews, and weekly journal.
- **[Stoat (ex-Revolt)](https://stt.gg/NfjD0BwP)** – Live chat.

### Relay-Only Platforms

These platforms are used in a limited manner, primarily to relay links to new website pages or publications, **without** platform-specific engagement.

- **[X (ex-Twitter)](https://x.com/EuropeanDream_)** – Link sharing only.

### Reserved or Inactive Platforms

The following accounts are currently inactive or lightly used. They are reserved for potential future use or name protection purposes and should not be considered active communication channels at this time.

- **[Discord](https://discord.gg/w6CDF7pMWn)**
- **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/european.dream.official/)**
- **[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/european_dream_official/)**
- **[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/European_Dream/)**
- **[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@european_dream_official)**
- **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@european-dream)**

### Editorial Principle

European Dream does not aim to maximise presence across all platforms indiscriminately.

Our approach prioritises consistency, clarity, and meaningful interaction over visibility alone. Platform usage may evolve over time as the project develops.
