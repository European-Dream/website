**This roadmap is a living document – perhaps the fastest to evolve among our foundational texts. It will adjust as European Dream grows, shaped by the people who join, the conversations we have, and the realities we encounter. What follows is our best current sense of direction, not a rigid plan.**

## 2026 – Our Birth

### First Quarter – Foundations

Establishing European Dream as a legal entity – a French 1901 association – with its initial cofounders. Building the project's public presence: a fully functional website hosting our foundational documents, and a meaningful footprint across the platforms aligned with our values.

This is where we lay the first stones: the manifesto, the goals, and the organisational principles that will guide everything that follows.

- ✓ Manifesto published
- ✓ [Website](https://european-dream.eu) launched
- ✓ [Social media presence](https://european-dream.eu/contact/#social-media) established
- ✓ [Community chat](https://stt.gg/NfjD0BwP) set up (Stoat)
- ✓ Foundational documents (Goals, Social Media Strategy)
- ◐ French translation of the website
- ○ Find at least one cofounder
- ○ Register the 1901 association

### Second Quarter – Opening Doors

Reaching out – to individuals, communities, and initiatives that share or challenge our vision. The aim is not to recruit, but to encounter: to listen, to exchange, and to let the European Dream community grow to a few dozen engaged members.

This is also where we begin to understand who we are as a group, and what kinds of conversations we are capable of having together. Exploration – in the sense described in our Goals – begins in earnest here.

- ○ Outreach to aligned communities and individuals
- ○ First engaged members beyond the founding group
- ○ First community conversations on Stoat

### Third Quarter – Deepening

Revisiting and strengthening our foundational documents in light of the community that now exists around them. Our values, our vocabulary, and our organisational principles deserve to be tested against the perspectives of those who have joined.

As the community grows, dreaming – collective deliberation on what our new worlds could be – naturally joins exploration.

- ○ Community review of foundational documents
- ○ First collective deliberations

### Fourth Quarter – Gathering

Organising our first community event – whether online, in person, or both – and giving our internal organisation a shape that can support the next phase of growth. This is also when we begin reaching beyond the languages we started with, opening the door to new localised communities and translations.

By the end of our first year, European Dream should feel like a living initiative, not just a set of documents.

- ○ First community event
- ○ Internal organisation structured
- ○ First new localised communities and translations

## 2027 – Across Europe

Growing our presence across the European Union, with the aspiration of nurturing communities – and their translations – in as many member states as we can reach. If multi-country governance makes it necessary and feasible, migrating from the French 1901 association to a Belgian AISBL.

As the initiative becomes genuinely European – not just in vision, but in the diversity of voices that carry it – all four dimensions of our Goals come alive in parallel: exploring, dreaming, architecting, and the first steps towards experimenting.

## 2028 – Our First Experiments

Reaching the most exhilarating step of our Goals: living our European Dream. Designing and launching our first real-world experiments – however small, however local – to test whether the ideas we have explored, dreamed, and architected can hold when they meet reality.
