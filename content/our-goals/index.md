Our goals share the same hope: to move beyond transactionalism by building realistic foundations for holomutualist societies — sensible and tangible — that future generations can adopt and build upon.

We believe such a generation will come. The question is not *whether*, but *when*.

These alternatives are — for us — inseparable from ecosystem balance, freedom, wisdom, and thoughtful technological progress.

This may sound like an unattainable dream. But we believe this sentiment of impossibility is the perfect illustration of the difference between realism and renouncement. The more you dare to challenge assumptions you may have never thought to question, the more you may be surprised at how outdated our world is at a foundational level.

Whether you look at our current societies through empathy and see how inhuman and destructive we have become, or through reason and see how inefficient we are at making impactful progress and solving the largest problems we face — it is hard to believe there are no better ways to live.

This is what our goals challenge, with hope but no delusion. We will fail — likely many times — and we will learn. Because if it were easy, our societies would already have found it.

It will require an incredible amount of patience, time, and reflection. Urgency does not exist within European Dream. Only importance does. And any rhythm is acceptable.

## We explore

Before we can imagine alternatives, we need to understand what has already been tried, thought, and learned. Exploration is the foundation of everything else.

We survey academic research and literature across sociology, economics, political science, anthropology, and philosophy. We study past experiments in alternative social organisation — from intentional communities to cooperative movements, from historical utopias to contemporary initiatives. We conduct interviews with experts who have dedicated their lives to these questions, and with ordinary citizens whose lived experience holds insights no theory can capture.

The guiding question is simple: *what do we know?* Not what do we assume, not what feels intuitive — but what has actually been documented, tested, debated, and refined by those who came before us.

Exploration never ends. Every experiment we run, every debate we have, generates new questions that send us back to the sources.

## We dream

Dreaming is where knowledge becomes imagination. We take what the Explorers gather and ask: *what if?*

This is the space for debate, for design, for bold hypotheses about how human societies could be organised differently. Not utopian blueprints — we are suspicious of anyone who claims to have the answer — but serious, structured proposals that can be examined, challenged, and refined through collective deliberation.

Dreaming requires both creativity and discipline. It is easy to imagine perfect worlds; it is harder to imagine *possible* worlds — arrangements that account for human nature as it is, not as we wish it were, while still daring to believe we can do better than we currently do.

The proposals that emerge from this work are not conclusions. They are hypotheses — questions posed to reality, waiting to be tested.

## We architect

A dream without a plan remains a dream. Architecting is where we prepare our ideas for contact with the real world.

We assess feasibility: what resources, skills, and conditions would this proposal require? We study legal compatibility: can this experiment be conducted within the frameworks that govern us, or do we need to adapt it? We define scope: how small can we start while still learning something meaningful? We plan logistics: who, where, when, and how?

Architecting is humble work. It often means scaling back ambitious visions to something testable. It means confronting the gap between what we imagine and what we can actually do — and finding ways to bridge it, step by step.

The output is not a manifesto but a protocol: a clear enough design that volunteers can participate, that outcomes can be observed, and that lessons can be drawn.

## We experiment

Theory is not enough. At some point, we must try.

Experimentation is where our proposals meet reality — in small-scale, real-world tests with real volunteers, in conditions designed to generate genuine learning. We do not experiment to prove we are right; we experiment to discover what works, what fails, and why.

Every experiment is documented. Successes and failures alike are shared openly, so that others — within European Dream and beyond — can build on what we learn. The goal is not to protect our ideas but to improve them, and to contribute to a shared body of knowledge that outlasts any single initiative.

We expect most experiments to fail, at least partially. That is not defeat; it is the price of genuine inquiry. What matters is that each failure teaches us something — and that we have the patience to try again, differently, informed by what we have learned.
