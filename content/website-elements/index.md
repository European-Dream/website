This page presents the content elements and components available on the European Dream website.

It shows how common elements (text, images, quotes, lists, shortcodes, etc.) look when published, together with simple examples of how to use them.
No technical knowledge is required to read or use this page.

**Accessibility note**

European Dream considers **accessibility** a fundamental value. This means that all published content should remain readable, understandable, and usable by as many people as possible.

For this reason, contributors are encouraged to keep a few simple principles in mind, such as:
- using clear headings and a logical structure
- providing meaningful text for links and images
- avoiding content that relies only on colour, layout, or visual effects to convey meaning

These principles help keep the website **inclusive and welcoming to everyone 💚**.

## Headings

First-level headings are reserved for the page title, which is automatically generated.
In practice, this means using second-level headings and below in pages and posts, as the first-level heading is expected to be unique for accessibility purposes.

# First-level heading

## Second-level heading

### Third-level heading

#### Fourth-level heading

##### Fifth-level heading

###### Sixth-level heading

## Lists

### Ordered List

1. Start doing what is necessary,
2. then do what is possible,
3. and suddenly you are doing the impossible.

---

### Unordered List

- Wealth without work.
- Pleasure without conscience.
- Knowledge without character.
- Commerce without morality.
- Science without humanity.
- Religion without sacrifice.
- Politics without principle.
