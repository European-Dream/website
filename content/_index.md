## Our purpose

European Dream is an experimental initiative exploring whether and how human cooperation can function with a reduced dependence on currency-based, transactional relations, within the legal, social, and cultural framework of the European Union.

The project does not propose a ready-made alternative system. Its purpose is to test, document, and evaluate possibilities that do not yet have a stable or agreed form.

Modern societies are structurally organised around currency as the primary coordination mechanism. European Dream starts from the assumption that this model, while efficient, may be insufficient to address long-term social cohesion, ecological limits, and human well-being. This assumption is treated as a hypothesis to be examined through practice, not as a truth.

## An experimental approach

The initiative explores paths away from purely transactional logic, potentially involving partial de-monetisation of certain activities, non-monetary forms of contribution and reciprocity, shared responsibility over shared ownership, and trust-based or commons-oriented coordination models. No specific model is privileged. Failure is an acceptable and expected outcome.
